GOAL:
The goal of this project is to create a project that scans a locally stored list of band websites and looks for tour dates within the next 3 months in the local area. Any matching entries will be returned in a table format similar to below.

_BAND_    	_DATE_      _LOCATION_
band1		date1		location1
band2		date2		location2

INITIAL GOALS
1) How to scrape websites.
2) How to store scraped website
3) how to reduce data stored/scraped to date table for each site
	3.1) detect if "table" structure is present or if not formatted as a table. 
4) how to deal with multiple tour layout formations
5) how to search through the tour layout

FUTURE GOALS
1) Order shows by date closest to current date first then alphabetical. 
2) Modify ordering through use of a flag for alphabet first. 
3) Store entries in a local file only if not entered in the file already
4) If date of show has passed then remove it from the local file.
